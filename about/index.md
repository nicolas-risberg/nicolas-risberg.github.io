Hello lovely people at Fatshark! My name is Nicolas Risberg, and this is my application for the Generalist Programmer role for the period of 2021-2022.
I am a big fan of the studio. Playing the exhilarating experience that is Warhammer: Vermintide 2 to relieve stress led me to my choice of specialization and it would make me very happy to find a spot on your upcoming Darktide title, which I am very much looking forward to.
I believe I am the perfect pick for you as I find all areas of game programming fascinating.
Having just graduated from The Game Assembly, I have worked in many areas of game development for small projects. What interests me the most right now is Render, Audio and UI programming, but I have also authored gameplay systems and other engine architectures.
I am self-motivated and curious, always eager to learn the finer details of how something works. When I problem solve, I always go about it in an analytical, careful fashion. This stems from my science background, where I discovered what it means to truly understand something, and the joy of exploration in general.  

To me, the most important part of being a team player is empathy and openness, and I think this approach is key in my ability to cooperate with others. I own my mistakes and take every opportunity I can to learn from others.

Thank you for reading, I am looking forward to getting to know you better!
