<h3>Background</h3>

Hi! My name is Nicolas but I prefer to be called Nico. I started my educational journey as a music student, playing the guitar in upper secondary school in southern Sweden. 
After moving to Stockholm I worked for a couple of years before switching to Astronomy, earning a BSc in Astronomy at Stockholm University. This is where I cultivated 
my love for programming.

<br></br>

After hearing that The Game Assembly was starting a branch in Stockholm, I signed up as fast as I could, and now I can't wait to start my career as a Game Programmer!

<h3>Game Programming Experience</h3> 

Having soon graduated from The Game Assembly, I have worked in many areas of game development for small projects. What interests me the most right now is Render, 
Audio and UI programming, but I have also authored gameplay systems such as the <b><a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/2020-12-22/game-project-6.html">ability system</a></b> 
for a Diablo-like RPG we made and the game object <b><a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/2020-06-17/game-project-5.html">components</a></b> constituting most of the 
gameplay logic in a top-down 2D puzzle adventure project. 

<br></br>

Feel free to check out an in depth rundown of some of the projects I've worked on in the <b><a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/projects/">Game Projects</a></b> tab,
as well as the <b><a href="https://nicolas-risberg.github.io/highlights/">Highlights</a></b> section, where I detail certain features of the 3D engine we built 
that I'm especially happy with!

<h3>Working With Me</h3>

I am self-motivated and curious, always eager to learn the finer details of how something works. When I problem solve, I always go about it in an analytical, careful fashion. 
This stems from my science background, where I discovered what it means to truly understand something, and the joy of exploration in general.  

To me, the most important part of being a team player is empathy and openness, and I think this approach is key in my ability to cooperate with others. 
I own my mistakes and take every opportunity I can to learn from others.

<br></br>

Thank you for reading! I hope we get the opportunity to change the games industry for the better together.
